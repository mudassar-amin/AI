# AI - Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Pursuit-Evasion Scenarios

Abstractâ€”In the area of multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we will explore exciting grid problem where
we have a bounty hunter, a assistant, and a robber.
Our research centers on using Q-learning strategies to
understand how these agents interact in different settings,
ranging from simple grid environments to more complex
scenarios. Through this report, we showed how our approach/implementation trains these agents so that they can
reach the target either in case if looting the reward or
catching the robber.
